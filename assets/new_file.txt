Make Me A Video Game!

I the brave and smart Lauren have stole Rachel's spooky sister and plan to steal her pretty dogs!

What are a bear and backpacking frog to do? Before you can help Bridget, you'll have to collect the fuzzy pencils and dirty flies that open up the 50 worlds connected to A Ryan's Lair. There are 6 butterflies and 6 peaches in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
